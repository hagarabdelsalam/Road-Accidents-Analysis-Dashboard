# Road-Accidents-Analysis-Dashboard
üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data using Tableau to identify key factors contributing to accidents. The dashboard provides insights into weather conditions, accident severity, vehicle types, accident timing, and geographic distribution.

üéØ Objectives
Identify the main causes of accidents.
Determine which district has the highest number of severe accidents.
Analyze the impact of weather conditions on accident severity.
Discover peak accident times and dates.

üö¶ Road Safety Recommendations

1Ô∏è‚É£ Improve Traffic Management in High-Risk Districts
York, Birmingham, and Leeds have the highest accident rates.
Action: Increase traffic monitoring, install speed cameras, and improve road signage in these areas.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Speed Control Measures
Most accidents occur in fine weather conditions, indicating reckless driving.
Action: Enforce stricter speed limits, introduce speed bumps, and enhance police patrols in accident-prone areas.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Increase Awareness of Winter Driving Risks
Snowing (no high winds) is the most dangerous weather condition.
Action: Educate drivers on safe driving techniques during snowy conditions and provide better road salting to prevent skidding.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Enhance Infrastructure on Single Carriageways
Single carriageways account for the highest number of accidents and casualties.
Action: Widen roads where possible, add better lane markings, and improve street lighting.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Strengthen Urban Traffic Regulations
The majority of accidents occur in urban areas.
Action: Implement stricter pedestrian safety measures, redesign intersections, and introduce better public transport options to reduce congestion.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Address Peak Accident Times
Accidents are consistent throughout the year but slightly decrease in December.
Action: Conduct accident prevention campaigns year-round, with special attention to high-risk months.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Improve Road Surface Conditions
Wet and damp roads contribute to significant accidents.
Action: Increase road maintenance efforts, install better drainage systems, and use high-friction road surfaces.
