# Road-Accidents-Analysis-Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes road accident data using Tableau to identify key factors contributing to accidents. The dashboard provides insights into weather conditions, accident severity, vehicle types, accident timing, and geographic distribution.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Identify the main causes of accidents.

Determine which district has the highest number of severe accidents.

Analyze the impact of weather conditions on accident severity.

Discover peak accident times and dates.

Evaluate road conditions, vehicle involvement, and accident trends over time.
Final Insights from the Dashboard
The majority of accidents happen in normal weather conditions, suggesting that driver behavior or road infrastructure might be more critical factors.
York is the most accident-prone district, followed by Birmingham and Leeds.
Single carriageway roads are the most dangerous.
The number of accidents remains stable throughout the year, with a slight drop in December.
